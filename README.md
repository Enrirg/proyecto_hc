Game 1: Maze
The game is based on the users ability to cross from one end of the maze to the other, the user will draw lines with each click on the screen and this lines will draw the users trayectory.
In order to develop our proyect, we modifided the widht and color of the maze´s walls and the width and color of the lines drawn by the user.



Game 2: Paint
In the second exercise wich name is "paint.py", we actually add some functions that we called: (pentagon, horizontal, square, triangle and circle) the name explains the functionality by itself, it allows the user tu give an input and to draw wichever figure in the list of options and changing of figure just pressing another key.
